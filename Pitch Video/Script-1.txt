Shockwave!  A SciFi puzzle game for the nes.

To complete each level, in Shockwave, the player must move blocks about, in order to collect all the crystals, using shockwaves.

Shockwave features:
Simple and intuitive controls,
A time limit per level,
A persistent high score from level to level,
Health and lives,
Bonus points for every second under the time limit,
Two player puzzle solving,
And a save game feature, allowing for continued play later

Unique to Shockwave is:
It’s puzzle solving, as there are few puzzle games available on the NES,
It’s interactive scenery, with destructible and moveable objects,
Also, unlike most NES games which are aimed at a low skill level, Shockwave challenges the player with it’s 
unforgiving puzzles and unexpected consequences from player actions.

To develop this game, we ask for
A staff of seven people
Seven computers
A NES for testing
A generous marketing budget
And office space for seven
We predict then a total development cost of One million, six hundred and twenty thousand pounds.

But with sales of 1.5 million in the first two years, a profit of: over twenty million pounds.

But even with a reserved estimate of 500k sales, we calculate a profit of: over five point six million pounds;

Making Shockwave the right game to invest in.

We thankyou for your time.
